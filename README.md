# Micro-Interactions Library

A small collection of lightweight micro-interactions built with **pure HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**.  
This project was created as a hands-on exercise to explore how subtle UI details can improve the overall user experience without relying on heavy frameworks or libraries.

## [Live Demo](https://silvvrodriguez.github.io/micro-interactions-library/) 


## What’s inside

This repository contains **4 simple micro-interactions**, designed to be easy to understand, reuse, and customize:

- No external dependencies
- Pure vanilla JavaScript and CSS
- Each interaction is isolated and copy-paste friendly
- Focused on clarity and learning rather than abstraction


## Included interactions

### 1. Ripple Button
A Material Design–inspired click effect implemented with CSS and JavaScript.

### 2. Magnetic Button
A hover interaction where the button slightly follows the cursor, creating a subtle magnetic effect.

### 3. Glow Card
A card component with an animated gradient border that appears on hover.

### 4. Smooth Scroll
A simple smooth scrolling behavior for in-page navigation.


## Tech stack

- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, transitions, animations)
- HTML5

This project intentionally avoids frameworks and build tools to keep the code approachable and easy to modify.


## Usage

Each interaction lives in its own folder.  
You can copy the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files directly into your project and adjust the styles or behavior as needed.

No setup or build step is required.


## Why this project?

I built this project as a **learning and experimentation exercise** focused on micro-interactions—small details that can make interfaces feel more polished and engaging.

The main goals were:
- To practice combining **UI design and front-end development**
- To better understand animation, timing, and user feedback
- To create reusable interaction patterns without unnecessary complexity

I especially enjoyed experimenting with hover states and motion timing, and seeing how small changes can noticeably affect the feel of an interface.

Animations are intentionally subtle to avoid excessive motion and keep interactions comfortable to use.
